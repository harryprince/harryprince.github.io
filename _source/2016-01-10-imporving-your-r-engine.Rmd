Today, I am introducing a power tool to improve your R engine performance without changing any R code in lots of features, like parallel, pipeline operation, compatible with Rstudio. Revolution R Open executes a typical R benchmark 2.5 times faster than the standard R distribution and some functions, such as linear regression, run up to 20 times faster.

Here is the download link for Revolution R Open.
