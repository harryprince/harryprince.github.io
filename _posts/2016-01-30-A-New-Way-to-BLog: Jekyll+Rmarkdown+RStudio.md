Thanks for [Yihui Xie and his GitHub repo](https://github.com/yihui/knitr-jekyll), I find a good way to write blog in Rmarkdwon, which could support dynamic documentation, and display code and result simutaniously, and the command is pretty simple in RStudio.

```
servr::jekyll()
```

Now, this blog is hosted by GitHub, which provide a free jekyll server for bloger.

My main editor switch from Atom to RStudio, which give me a more powerful computation and interactive environment.
